% Inputs:
% num_wingbeats - number of wingbeats recorded during experiment
% results - (n x 6) raw force transducer data

% Returns:
% For simplicity, let's say p = num_wingbeats, m = frames_per_beat
% wingbeat_forces - (6 x p x m) forces and moments for each wingbeat (total
%                   of p wingbeats) and at each moment in time over that
%                   wingbeat (total of m moments where data was sample,
%                   i.e. a frame)
% frames - (m) an array of wingbeat timesteps
% wingbeat_avg_forces - (6 x m) forces produced on average over the course
%                       of a wingbeat
% wingbeat_SD_forces - (6 x m) standard deviation of forces across
%                      wingbeats over the course of a wingbeat
% wingbeat_rmse_forces - (6 x m) root mean square error of forces across
%                        wingbeats over the course of a wingbeat
% wingbeat_max_forces - (6 x m) max of forces over across wingbeats over
%                       the course of a wingbeat
% wingbeat_min_forces - (6 x m) min of forces over across wingbeats over
%                       the course of a wingbeat
% wingbeat_COP - (1 x m) average center of pressure location over the
%                course of a wingbeat
% cycle_avg_forces - (6 x p) average force produced for each
%                    wingbeat
