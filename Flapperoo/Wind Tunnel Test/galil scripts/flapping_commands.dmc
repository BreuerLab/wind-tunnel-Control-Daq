'Run on Galil DMC 4143 with AMP-43547
'The amplifier plays a critical role in determining how the stepper is run.
'Make sure not only to read up on 4143 manual, but pay specific attention to
'sections discussing the AMP-43547.
'There are a lot of comments in this file, if you comment incorrectly you 
'will get mysterious bugs so be careful adding comments.
