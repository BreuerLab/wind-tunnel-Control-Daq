Instroctions For Weak Generator
1. install the wing profile and aline the trailing edge with marker on the motor shaft.
This provide a start position of the flapper
2. deploy the flapper with aid rail system and suction cups;
3. run the poscontrol to set the origin position, this will give a origin position of a 
cosine motion.
4. run the driving code. 
the driving code is specfied with different pre-tuned parameters to have a consistant 
amplitude and frequency under different working conditions.
For instance, M_10Hz reperesnt a driving code for midium wing at 10Hz frequency.
