# wind-tunnel-DAq
## Calibration

-	Collect calibration data (Taking_Calibration_Data.m)
-	Process calibration data to get calibration matrix (Calibration_Matrix_SVD.m)
## Experiments

-	Put setup in the wind tunnel and collect data from tunnel (Wind_Tunnel_Data_Collection.m)
-	Process wind tunnel data (Wind_Tunnel_Data_Processing.m)
   -*Note this script needs editing based on how you collect data/ is not complete*
