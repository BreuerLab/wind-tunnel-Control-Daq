# wind-tunnel-DAq
## Experiments
1.	Collect calibration data (Taking_Calibration_Data.m)
2.	Process calibration data to get calibration matrix (Calibration_Matrix_SVD.m)
3.	Put setup in the wind tunnel and collect data from tunnel (Wind_Tunnel_Data_Collection.m)
4.	Process wind tunnel data (Wind_Tunnel_Data_Processing.m)
*Note this script needs editing based on how you collect data/ is not complete*

## Attached folders
Scripts from Jenya/summer experiments: **Jenya**
Script from Alex april 2020 that works, but was not very modular: voltageToForces.m , this relies on a few other files in this folder: **april23Matlab**
